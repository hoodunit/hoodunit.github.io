In my previous post I argue that JavaScript is by default a low trust environment for programming, that ideas that build trust like optional typing, functional transformations, and immutability have severe trade-offs in JavaScript, and that choosing one of these ideas often means rejecting another. Despite that, JavaScript is a better environment than most popular languages for building trust, and the broader argument applies to most popular languages, typed or not.

In PureScript you get types, immutability, and functional programming “for free”– the trade-offs aren’t as steep. This is largely true of a few other languages as well, but let’s see what our discussion of fear and trust from the previous post looks like in PureScript from the same two perspectives: understanding the shape of data and changing data.
